# OSProject
Linux USB Driver for a Nintendo GameCube Controller

## Overview
This was a project for my Operating Systems class. I had to customize part of the Linux kernel, and develop in C. Developing in C was very weird for me, but I'm proud with the resulting code, and the concepts that I learned.
